<Joe> So, if I'm understanding that correctly, Bitcoin is a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash, and transactions are not subject to third-party financial institutions. Is that right, Adam?
<Adam> Exactly, Joe. Bitcoin essentially allows for direct transactions between parties online, without the requirement of a typical financial institution to oversee or process the payments. In particular, it eliminates the need for a trusted third party to prevent double-spending, which is a significant issue in digital transactions.
<Joe> I see, so how are these transactions verified if not through a financial institution?
<Adam> Well, this is where the uniqueness of Bitcoin's architecture comes in. It uses a peer-to-peer network to verify transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work. This forms a record that cannot be altered without redoing the proof-of-work. So, as long as the majority of the CPU power used in this network isn't attempting to attack the system, the longest chain of proof-of-work remains the authoritative record of events.
<Joe> What can you tell about commercial use of bitcoin, Sarah?
<Sarah> In Internet commerce, Bitcoin could potentially overcome some key limitations of the traditional financial system. For example, completely non-reversible transactions are difficult in a traditional system because of the need for financial institutions playing a mediating role in disputes. This mediation often leads to increased transaction costs and makes very small, casual transactions impractical. However, Bitcoin's system minimizes these costs and allows for the possibility of small, casual transactions. Moreover, with Bitcoin, non-reversible payments can be made for non-reversible services. This could potentially usher in a broader range of transaction possibilities.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> That's quite an introduction Adam. Let's break it down a bit. So, the issue with the current e-commerce system is that there's too much dependency on financial institutions for processing electronic payments. This adds an additional layer, increasing costs and decreasing trust. Is that correct?
<Adam> Yes, Joe, you're spot on. Because financial institutions serve as an intermediary, disputes are unavoidable and this also adds to the costs. Non-reversible transactions are almost impossible in this model, which limits the possibilities of certain types of transactions and services. What's more, there's an inherent risk of fraud, and a degree of uncertainty when it comes to payments.
<Joe> There's much to unpack there. Sarah, from a broader perspective, what kind of impact do these issues have on commerce as a whole?
<Sarah> Well, Joe, these issues add to the hurdles of commerce expansion, especially when it comes to smaller, casual transactions, like paying for a cup of coffee. In the current system, these small transactions may not be practical due to the higher transaction costs resulting from mediation. Similarly, the inability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services curbs the scope of commercial activities. This adds a layer of caution and uncertainty from the merchants' side as they could fall prey to fraud.
<Joe> So, the solution proposed here - an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof, would that eliminate the need for a trusted third party, Adam?
<Adam> Exactly, Joe. The system proposed here relies on cryptographic proof, making transactions computational impractical to reverse. This protects sellers from fraud. Routine escrow mechanisms could also be implemented to protect buyers. The proposed payment system also solves the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server. It secures transactions as long as the honest nodes have more control over the CPU power than any possible attacking nodes.
<Joe> That sounds promising. But I'm curious, how does this proposed system define an electronic coin?
<Adam> Excellent question, Joe. An electronic coin in this system is defined as a chain of digital signatures. The coin is transferred from one owner to another by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the Public Key of the next owner, then adding these to the end of the coin. This ensures a secure and traceable transaction between parties.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> Reading through this, I'm curious to know how exactly this peer-to-peer timestamp server works as a solution to the double-spending problem. Can you describe its function a bit more, Adam?
<Adam> A peer-to-peer timestamp server provides an objective chronological order of transactions. In this system, every transaction is publicly announced, so everyone can have awareness of every transaction. The payee, the person receiving the payment, needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed - in an unanimous manner - that this transaction was the first of its kind. If most nodes agree, then there's assurance that the coin hasn't been spent before, forming a security against double-spending.
<Joe> That's interesting. And how does the control of CPU power factor into the security of this system, Sarah?
<Sarah> Excellent question. In such a system, the security relies heavily on the combined CPU power of honest nodes– the participants validating and recording transactions - being greater than any potential group of cooperating attacker nodes. The fundamental idea here is that as long as the majority of the CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not trying to cheat the system, they'll outpace any attacker nodes. This is a key factor in upholding the integrity of the system.
<Joe> You mentioned the term 'nodes' a few times. Could you clarify exactly what they are within this context?
<Adam> Certainly, Joe. In this context, nodes refer to the computers participating in the system. Each one of them records and validates transactions. When we talk about a majority of nodes agreeing on something, we're describing a scenario where most participating computers in the network reach a consensus, for instance, confirming the legitimacy and order of transactions.
<Joe> Makes sense. I understand that to ensure no double-spending occurs, every transaction must be publicly announced. But how is privacy preserved in such a model, Sarah?
<Sarah> That is indeed a challenge, Joe. This paper does not go into detail about preserving privacy in such a scenario. However, in current blockchain networks, which operate on similar principles, transactions are publicly visible but they are linked to an address, not to the identity of an individual. This pseudo-anonymity is a common method to maintain some degree of privacy in such systems.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> Okay, there's a lot to unpack here. It seems that in moving from a mint-based model to a decentralized system, we need to shift transactions to the public arena and establish a mutual consensus on transaction history. Can you elaborate on this for us, Adam?
<Adam> Absolutely, Joe. Instead of relying on a central mint, participants in a decentralized network must make transactions public. This means that everyone can see the transactions, but can't directly associate them with the individuals involved. The main problem to solve here is to agree on the order of transactions - for this we will need a method to ensure that the majority of the network acknowledges the chronology of these transactions.
<Joe> Sarah, can you tell us more about the role of the timestamp server in this system?
<Sarah> Of course, Joe. The timestamp server is a crucial part of the system. It authenticates the timing of transactions, by creating a unique hash of a block of transactions and making it public. This timestamp verifies that the data existed at that particular time. Each new timestamp includes the previous one in its hash, which forms an unbreakable chain. Thus, it's virtually impossible to alter a record without disrupting the entire chain.
<Joe> It sounds secure but quite complex. Can someone give more details on the proof-of-work concept?
<Adam> Proof-of-work is a protocol that discourages arbitrariness and abuse within decentralized systems. It enforces a cost on the participants, in terms of computing power, to confirm transactions and create new blocks on the chain. This is done by finding a unique value (nonce) that, when hashed, starts with a set number of zero bits. It's computationally hard to find, but once found, easy to verify - which maintains a healthy balance in the system.
<Sarah> And to add to that, once the process of proof-of-work has been completed for a block, any change to that block would require the proof to be done all over again. And as the blocks are interlinked, redoing the work for one block would mean redoing the work for all subsequent blocks. So, it’s self-protecting in a way.
<Joe> So the intensity of the computational effort needed to alter a block coupled with the interconnected nature of the block sequence creates a safe environment? Sounds like a well-protected system!
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> That's a lot to take in! So, in essence, the proof-of-work system is a defense mechanism against fraudulent actions?
<Adam> Exactly Joe. It is designed such that altering a block would require so much computational power that it would be virtually impossible. The assigned difficulty of the proof-of-work determines the number of zero bits required in the hash value, and this difficulty can vary based on network conditions.
<Sarah> Additionally, the network's operation plays an essential role in ensuring security. Transactions are broadcast to all nodes, each of which works to find a proof-of-work. When a node finds it, the block is broadcast to all nodes which then have to accept it only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
<Joe> This mechanism where each block is verified and accepted by all nodes, it further contributes to the protection of the network, correct?
<Adam> Very much so, Joe. This consensus algorithm ensures that a majority of nodes have to agree for a new block to be accepted into the blockchain.
<Joe> But what if an attacker has control of majority nodes?
<Sarah> Very unlikely, thanks to the one-CPU-one-vote system. Any attempts to modify past blocks would require redoing the proof-of-work for all subsequent blocks on top of catching up with the work of the honest nodes, a feat nearly impossible to achieve since the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially with each block added.
<Joe> How does the system adapt to increases in hardware speed, which could theoretically make blocks be generated too quickly?
<Adam> The system dynamically adjusts the difficulty of the proof-of-work to maintain an average rate of block creation. If blocks are being generated too quickly, i.e., more rapidly than the target rate, the difficulty increases. This ensures that regardless of hardware advancement, the system remains secure and stable.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> So, if I understand correctly, each node is actively creating a new block and finding proof-of-work for it. Could you elaborate more on that, Adam?
<Adam> That's correct, Joe. Each node is essentially working on a kind of complex mathematical problem. It tries to find a number that, when hashed along with the block data, produces a result that fits within defined conditions. This is the proof-of-work, a key concept in the blockchain technology.
<Joe> And then, all nodes are notified about the new block, Sarah?
<Sarah> Yes, Joe. Once a node has found a proof-of-work, it announces or 'broadcasts' its block to the entire network. The other nodes then scrutinize the proposed block.
<Joe> And what criteria do they consider when scrutinizing a new block?
<Adam> Well, a block is accepted by other nodes only if all transactions within it are valid and haven't been spent previously. If the block passes this vetting process, other nodes express their acceptance by working on creating the next block, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash in the chain.
<Joe> What happens if two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block at the same time?
<Sarah> In such cases, nodes will work on the first block they received but will save the other block just in case it turns out to be part of the longer chain. This is because nodes always recognize the longest chain to be the correct one and they keep extending it.
<Joe> I see. Now, don't these transactions need to reach all nodes?
<Adam> Not necessarily, Joe. New transactions just need to reach enough nodes to be included in a block fairly soon. If they manage to reach a substantial number of nodes, they'll get embedded into a block before long. Block broadcasts are fairly tolerant of missed messages as well.
<Joe> Interesting. Let's talk more about the incentive aspect. Sarah, could you explain?
<Sarah> Sure, Joe. By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special one that initiates a new coin owned by the creator of that block. This serves as an incentive for nodes to support the network. The creation of new coins can be seen as a form of initial coin distribution since there is no central authority to issue them.
<Joe> So it's akin to how gold miners bring gold into circulation?
<Sarah> Exactly, Joe! But instead of physical resources, here we are expending CPU time and electricity. This process in context of cryptocurrency is often referred to as 'mining'.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> So, the first transaction in a block gets created by the block creator owning the coin? I'm guessing this is how new coins get circulated?
<Adam> Correct, Joe. This whole process adds an incentive for nodes to support the network. Also, the way new coins are constantly added is quite similar to how gold miners bring gold into circulation. Here, instead of physical resources, CPU time and electricity are expended.
<Joe> But how are these transaction fees working? How can they fund the incentive?
<Sarah> Transaction fees are another source of funding for the incentive. If a transaction's output value is less than its input value, the difference is considered a transaction fee. This fee is then added to the block's incentive value.
<Joe> So, these fees can potentially make the system completely inflation-free?
<Adam> Yes, Joe. Once a certain number of coins have been circulated, the system can shift completely to transaction fees. This way, it can avoid any further inflation.
<Joe> These incentives seem like they might promote honesty within the nodes, right?
<Sarah> Exactly. The system is designed in a way that discourages fraudulent activities. It is more profitable for a potential attacker with massive CPU power to stick to the rules than attempting to defraud the system.
<Joe> That's fascinating. Now, what about saving disk space? Are there any mechanisms in place to reclaim or save disk space?
<Adam> Yes, Joe. Once transactions get buried under enough blocks, previous transactions can be discarded. Essentially, transactions are stored in a data structure called a Merkle Tree, where only the root is included in the block's hash. This allows us to compact old blocks and save some space.
<Joe> How effective is this data storage system in terms of yearly storage growth?
<Sarah> With the current system, about 4.2MB is added every year considering blocks are generated every 10 minutes. Given that devices typically have 2GB of RAM and with yearly growth predicted by Moore's Law, it shouldn't be a problem to keep block headers in memory.
<Joe> This system seems well thought-out, accounting for everything from introducing new coins to managing storage efficiently. What's the principle behind these decisions?
<Adam> The whole blockchain network design is made keeping decentralization and robustness in mind. It's a delicate but necessary balance between incentivizing the system, keeping it secure, and making it scalable at the same time.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> So, it seems like the way Bitcoin is designed, you don't need to store a lot of data on your computer to take part in the network, right?
<Adam> Yes, that's correct. In essence, all you need to store are the block headers. Given that a block header without any transactions is roughly 80 bytes and blocks are generated every 10 minutes, the yearly storage requirement is just about 4.2MB. This is highly manageable given the usual computer system memory capacities and their growth rate through Moore's law.
<Joe> Can you simplify that whole concept of Simplified Payment Verification, Adam?
<Adam> Sure Joe. Simplified Payment Verification or SPV is a method where you don't need to run a full network node to verify payments. You just need to have the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain. You then can check the transaction by linking it to its place in the chain. As long as honest nodes control the system, this verification is dependable.
<Sarah> To add on to that, this method does however present a vulnerability. An attacker who can overpower the network can fabricate transactions and fool the SPV method. To mitigate this, alerts from network nodes detecting invalid blocks can be implemented. These alerts prompt the user to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm any inconsistencies.
<Joe> So what happens in businesses that receive frequent payments?
<Sarah> Well Joe, businesses that frequently receive payments would likely want to run their own nodes. This would allow for quicker verification and provide a more independent level of security.
<Joe> How about the concept of Combining and Splitting Value?
<Adam> Essentially, to prevent having to make a separate transaction for every minuscule amount in a transfer, it's possible to combine and split value. It’s a way to make transfers more efficient, without handling coins individually.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> Adam, can you explain how a network can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions?
<Adam> Sure, Joe. A network node usually verifies transactions for itself. But in a simplified version, if an attacker manages to overpower the network, fabricated transactions could be mistaken as genuine. One way to protect against this is to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, which triggers the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency.
<Joe> Sarah, could you elaborate on why businesses that receive frequent payments might want to run their own nodes?
<Sarah> Absolutely. Businesses that receive frequent payments would have more independent security and quicker verification by running their own nodes. It's a way to ensure another layer of protection against potential fraudulent activities.
<Joe> That's interesting. Adam, could you shed some light on the concept of combining and splitting value in transactions?
<Adam> Of course, Joe. To enable value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. You might have a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller sums. Most of the time, there are at most two outputs - one for the payment and another returning the change, if any, back to the sender.
<Joe> Sarah, how is privacy maintained in these public transactions?
<Sarah> Generally, in traditional banking, privacy is achieved by limiting access to information to the involved parties and a trusted third party. In this case, however, all transactions have to be public, posing a challenge to maintaining privacy. The workaround to this problem is keeping public keys anonymous, breaking the flow of information. The public can see someone is sending an amount to someone else but without information linking the transaction to anyone, similar to how stock exchanges operate.
<Joe>Adam, could you explain the use of new key pairs in each transaction?
<Adam> Sure, Joe. To enhance privacy, a new key pair should be used for each transaction. This prevents transactions from being linked to a common owner. It's like using a new identity for each transaction, enhancing privacy and security.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> I think I get the idea of keeping public keys anonymous to maintain privacy. But how does this relate to the stock exchange example?
<Sarah> If you think about it, Joe, information about trades made on stock exchanges is public - what time the trade happened, how big it was, etc. However, the identities of those who made the trade remains private, similar to the public keys in transactions. The idea is to provide transparency on the activity without compromising privacy.
<Joe> Right, I see. What happens though if the owner of a key is revealed? Wouldn't that pose some risk?
<Adam> Absolutely, Joe. If the key owner is revealed, it might be possible to link other transactions that belonged to the same owner. This is similar to having a single sender or receiver identified in a chain of transactions.
<Joe> I understand. It seems like there's considerable thought given to security as well. Like, what about attackers trying to generate a faster alternate chain?
<Adam> An interesting concern, indeed. In that scenario, even if an attacker is successful in creating an alternative chain faster than the honest chain, they won't be able to introduce invalid transactions or alter the system arbitrarily. You see, honest nodes will not accept any block that contains an invalid transaction as payment. The attacker can only try to modify one of their own transactions to reclaim the money they recently spent.
<Joe> Got it. And how is this situation described mathematically?
<Adam> Well, this scenario is characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. Essentially, the success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, while the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block. The odds of the attacker catching up from a specific deficit is a problem similar to the Gambler's Ruin problem, a concept in probability theory.
<Sarah> Yes, imagine a gambler with unlimited credit. They're starting at a deficit and play potentially infinite trials to try to break even. The probability that they ever reaches break even or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain can be computed using a specific formula. There's the assumption here that an honest node is more likely to find the next block - if that's the case, the attacker's chances drop exponentially the more blocks they are behind.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> So, looking at this from a practical application, how does p (probability an honest node finds the next block) usually compare to q (probability the attacker finds the next block)?
<Adam> Generally, p is greater than q, meaning that an honest node is more likely to find the next block. This is the basis of the blockchain's security—honest nodes are expected to find blocks faster than any single attacker could.
<Joe> How does this all impact the recipient of a new transaction? What do they need to do?
<Sarah> The recipient needs to wait for a period before they can confirm that the transaction is valid. This time period is to ensure the sender, who might be an attacker, cannot alter the transaction later. The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and additional blocks — usually denoted as ‘z’ — have been linked after it.
<Joe> So, how does a recipient ensure that a sender can't just prepare a chain of blocks ahead of time and execute a transaction at a well-chosen moment?
<Adam> To prevent this from happening, the recipient generates a new key pair just before signing and gives the public key to the sender shortly before. This way, the sender is unable to work on a parallel chain containing an alternate version of the transaction in advance, since he didn't have the final key pair until the last moment.
<Joe> What happens if a dishonest sender tries to work secretly on a parallel chain?
<Sarah> If a dishonest sender tries to work on a parallel chain in secret, containing an alternate version of his transaction, they would essentially be racing against the entire network. But as we assumed earlier that p > q, meaning an honest node is more likely to find the next block, the dishonest sender's chances of succeeding are generally lower and drop exponentially the longer they fall behind.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> Making sure I understand this correctly: the receiver in a transaction generates a new key pair, and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing. This helps thwart a dishonest sender trying to prepare a block chain ahead of time. Correct?
<Adam> Exactly, Joe. The idea here is to limit the sender's opportunities for foul play.
<Sarah> Absolutely, Joe. This ensures that even if the sender starts working secretly on an alternate version of the transaction, it won't be as effective because they can't start working far in advance.
<Joe>Interesting. I notice a lot of calculations here involving blocks, probability, Poisson distributions, and even some C coding. How do all these figures factor into this, Adam?
<Adam> The math here is used to estimate the likelihood of an attacker succeeding in double-spending. It takes the number of blocks added after our transaction into consideration, along with the time it took to add them, to make an educated guess about the progress the attacker might have made on their fraudulent chain.
<Sarah> To add to Adam's point, the Poisson distribution is used here to model the 'potential progress' the attacker might have made. It's a useful model in this case because we're dealing with independent attempts to solve a problem across intervals.
<Joe> Based on these calculations, I am seeing that the probability of an attacker catching up decreases exponentially as more blocks are added. Can you explain a bit more about that?
<Adam> Yes, Joe. The probability of an attacker catching up decreases as more blocks are added because, the more blocks added to the chain, the more progress the attacker would need to make to successfully double-spend. The chance of making enough progress decreases exponentially with each additional block.
<Joe> From what I gathered, this scheme attempts to eradicate the need for trust in electronic transactions. Correct?
<Sarah> That's right, Joe. This system is designed to mitigate the risk of double-spending by implementing a trust-less model. The primary concern in digital transactions - preventing double-spending, is addressed by a system of complex cryptographic processes and majority rule within the network.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> That's a lot of technical information, Adam. Can you simplify what this algorithm does?
<Adam> Sure, Joe. AttackerSuccessProbability is a function to calculate the probability of a successful attack on the network. It considers the amount of network power, denoted by 'q', the attacker possesses and the number of blocks, denoted by 'z', the network leads by. The algorithm calculates the chances of an attacker successfully altering the blockchain.
<Joe> So, it sounds like higher z means lower probability of a successful attack. Is that correct?
<Adam> Exactly, Joe. As z or the number of blocks the network leads by increases, the probability decreases exponentially. This is due to the proof-of-work system. The more blocks there are, the more computational power is needed to alter the blockchain, which makes it unlikely for an attacker.
<Sarah> And part of the beauty of this system is its simplicity. Nodes in the network work simultaneously with little coordination. They aren't identified and don't need to be since messages aren't routed to specific places. Nodes can also leave and rejoin the network at will. They accept the proof-of-work chain as proof of what occurred while they were gone.
<Joe> So this system is designed to be secure and flexible, allowing nodes to come and go without jeopardizing the integrity of the network?
<Sarah> Absolutely, Joe. The network's resiliency is in its unstructured simplicity. The consensus mechanism enforces necessary rules and incentives.
<Joe> Could you clarify what do you mean by 'consensus mechanism', Sarah?
<Sarah> Sure, Joe. Consensus mechanism means that nodes express their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. It is a democratic process - nodes vote with their computational power, i.e., their CPU power.
<------------breakage------------>
<Joe> Well it seems there are quite a few references we are dealing with here. Adam, could you give us a brief insight into 'Digital Time-Stamping' as mentioned in the works of Haber and Stornetta?
<Adam> Sure, Joe. Digital Time-Stamping is essentially a way to prove that certain digital data, like documents or transactions, existed in a certain state at a specific point in time. Haber and Stornetta proposed an innovative method of doing this, which plays a crucial role in the design of blockchain technology.
<Joe> Wow, quite fascinating. Could you tell us a bit more about 'Secure Names for Bit-Strings' and how they are relevant?
<Adam> Absolutely. The concept of 'Secure Names for Bit-Strings’ involves the creation of a name or identifier for a given data, such that changes to the data would change the identifier. This forms a significant aspect of data integrity verification—crucial in cryptographic protocols, including blockchain.
<Joe>  Thanks, Adam, got it. Now, moving on, Sarah, can you shed some light on what is 'Hashcash', as mentioned by A. Back, and how it is used as a denial of service counter-measure?
<Sarah> Of course, Joe. 'Hashcash' is a proof-of-work system proposed by Adam Back to limit email spam by requiring a sender to solve a complex computational problem before an email can be sent. Basically, it is designed to deter denial of service attacks by making them computationally expensive for the attacker.
<Joe> Interesting! And what about this work by R.C. Merkle on 'Protocols for public key cryptosystems'?
<Sarah> Public key cryptosystems, also known as asymmetric cryptography, rely on a pair of keys—one public and one private. Anyone can encrypt a message using the public key, but only someone with the private key can decrypt it. Ralph Merkle, one of the pioneers of public-key cryptography, has contributed significantly to the development of protocols that use this system, which are crucial in securing data transmitted over the network.
<Joe> That's very enlightening, Sarah. Lastly, can you contextualize W. Feller's work on probability theory and its applications for us?
<Sarah> W. Feller was an eminent mathematician whose work on probability theory has wide-reaching applications across many fields, including computer science and cryptography. Probability forms the basis of statistical algorithms and even cryptographic systems, adding an inherent layer of security. It guides the unpredictability and randomness in generating cryptographic keys and related protocols.
