<Joe> So, it seems like before a natural disaster strikes, suppliers are likely to rush critical supplies to the affected area if they anticipate higher prices. But if standard prices can be expected, there might be less incentive to incur the extra costs of rushing supplies to the disaster zone. Is that correct?
<Adam> Yes, Joe. That's right. The expectation of higher prices can actually motivate suppliers to overcome obstacles such as damaged roads and debris. Plus, each supplier has an incentive to be the first on the scene, as prices are highest before additional suppliers arrive and their resultant competition drives prices down.
<Joe> Sarah, why does it matter if these suppliers aren't the first ones there?
<Sarah> Well, Joe, it's a simple supply and demand dynamic. If a supplier gets there first, before the market is saturated with other suppliers offering similar goods, they can charge more due to the high demand. This translates to increased profits for them. But as more suppliers enter the picture, competition increases and prices usually decrease.
<Joe> This makes sense, but what if sellers decided to ration their goods instead of increasing prices? Wouldn't that solve the problem?
<Adam> Rationing can indeed be one of the methods to manage a resource crisis. But it also puts the seller in a difficult position. If they decline to sell as much as a customer wants, they risk offending the customer and potentially losing future business. Many sellers may not be willing to take this risk.
<Sarah> Yes, Adam is right, Joe. Also, historical examples show that price controls on goods, such as food, often lead to shortages, which can potentially escalate into situations of hunger or even starvation. Non-price rationing methods, such as asking people to limit their purchases during an emergency, often are not as effective as raising prices. For instance, during super storm Sandy in 2012, customers reportedly continued hoarding supplies despite public announcements urging them to buy only what they needed.
