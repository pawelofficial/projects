They were decreed by Hammurabi, king of Babylon, in the eighteenth century B.C. They were tried in ancient Athens. Henry Hazlitt{37} Nothing makes us understand the many roles of electricity in our lives like a power failure. Similarly, nothing shows more vividly the role and importance of price \ufb02uctuations in a market economy than the absence of such price \ufb02uctuations when the market is controlled. What happens when prices are not allowed to \ufb02uctuate freely according to supply and demand, but instead their \ufb02uctuations are \ufb01xed within limits set by law under various kinds of price controls? Typically, price controls are imposed in order to keep prices from rising to the levels that they would reach in response to supply and demand. The political rationales for such laws have varied from place to place and from time to time, but there is seldom a lack of rationales\nwhenever it becomes politically expedient to hold down some people\u2019s prices in the interest of other people whose political support seems more important. To understand the e\ufb00ects of price control, it is \ufb01rst necessary to understand how prices rise and fall in a free market. There is nothing esoteric about it, but it is important to be very clear about what happens. Prices rise because the amount demanded exceeds the amount supplied at existing prices. Prices fall because the amount supplied exceeds the amount demanded at existing prices. The \ufb01rst case is called a \u201cshortage\u201d and the second is called a \u201csurplus\u201d\u2014but both depend on existing prices. Simple as this might seem, it is often misunderstood, sometimes with disastrous consequences. PRICE \u201cCEILINGS\u201d AND SHORTAGES When there is a \u201cshortage\u201d of a product, there is not necessarily any less of it, either absolutely or relative to the number of consumers. During and immediately after the Second World War, for example, there was a very serious housing shortage in the United States, even though the country\u2019s population and its housing supply had both increased by about 10 percent from their prewar levels\u2014and there was no shortage when the war began.{38} In other words, even though the ratio between housing and people had not changed, nevertheless many Americans looking for an apartment during this period had to spend weeks or months in an often futile search for a place to live, or else resorted to bribes to get landlords to move them to the top of\nwaiting lists.

After rents rose in a free market, some childless couples living in four-bedroom apartments could decide that they would live in two-bedroom apartments and save the di\ufb00erence in rent.  Some late teenagers could decide that they would continue living with their parents a little longer, until their pay rose enough for them to be able to a\ufb00ord their own apartment, now that rent was no longer arti\ufb01cially cheap. The net result was that families looking for a place to stay found more places available, now that rent-control laws were no longer keeping such places occupied by people with less urgent requirements. In other words, the housing shortage immediately eased, even before there was time for new housing to be built, in response to market conditions that now made it possible to recover the cost of building more housing and earn a pro\ufb01t. Just as price \ufb02uctuations allocate scarce resources which have alternative uses, price controls which limit those \ufb02uctuations reduce the incentives for individuals to limit their own use of scarce resources desired by others. Rent control, for example, tends to lead to many apartments being occupied by just one person. A study in San\nFrancisco showed that 49 percent of that city\u2019s rent-controlled apartments had only a single occupant,{40} while a severe housing shortage in the city had thousands of people living considerable distances away and making long commutes to their jobs in San Francisco. Meanwhile, a Census report showed likewise that 46 percent of all households in Manhattan, where nearly half of all apartments are under some form of rent control, are occupied by only one person\u2014 compared to 27 percent nationwide.{41} In the normal course of events, people\u2019s demand for housing space changes over a lifetime. Their demand for space usually increases when they get married and have children. But, years later, after the children have grown up and moved away, the parents\u2019 demand for space may decline, and it often declines yet again after a spouse dies and the widow or widower moves into smaller quarters or goes to live with relatives or in an institution for the elderly. In this way, a society\u2019s total stock of housing is shared and circulated among people according to their changing individual demands at di\ufb00erent stages of their lives. This sharing takes place, not because the individuals themselves have a sense of cooperation, but because of the prices\u2014rents in this case\u2014which confront them. In a free market, these prices are based on the value that other tenants put on housing. Young couples with a growing family are often willing to bid more for housing, even if that means buying fewer consumer goods and services, in order to have enough money to pay for additional housing space.  A couple who begin to have children may cut back on how often they go out to restaurants or to movies, or they may wait longer to buy new clothes or a new car, in order that each child may have his or her own bedroom.\nBut, once the children are grown and gone, such sacri\ufb01ces may no longer make sense, when additional other amenities can now be enjoyed by reducing the amount of housing space being rented.

Politicians know that there are always more tenants than landlords and more people who do not understand economics than people who do.  That makes rent control laws something likely to lead to a net increase in votes for politicians who pass rent control laws.  Often it is politically e\ufb00ective to represent rent control as a way to keep greedy rich landlords from \u201cgouging\u201d the poor with \u201cunconscionable\u201d rents. In reality, rates of return on investments in housing are seldom higher than on alternative investments, and landlords are often people of very modest means. This is especially so\nfor owners of small, low-end apartment buildings that are in constant need of repair, the kinds of places where tenants are likely to be low- income people. Many of the landlords with buildings like this are handymen who use their own skills and labor as carpenters or plumbers to repair and maintain the premises, while trying to pay o\ufb00 the mortgage with the rents they collect. In short, the kind of housing likely to be rented by the poor often has owners who are by no means rich.{v} Where rent control laws apply on a blanket basis to all housing in existence as of the time the law goes into e\ufb00ect, even luxurious housing becomes low-rent housing. Then, after the passage of time makes clear that no new housing is likely to be built unless it is exempted from rent control, such exemptions or relaxations of rent control for new housing mean that even new apartments that are very modest in size and quality may rent for far more than older, more spacious and more luxurious apartments that are still under rent control. This non-comparability of rents has been common in European cities under rent control, as well as in New York and other American cities. Similar incentives produce similar results in many di\ufb00erent settings. A news story in the Wall Street Journal pointed up this non-comparability of rents under New York City\u2019s rent control laws: Les Katz, a 27-year-old acting student and doorman, rents a small studio apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side for $1,200\u2014with two roommates. Two sleep in separate beds in a loft built atop the kitchen, the third on a mattress in the main room. Across town on Park Avenue, Paul Haberman, a private investor, and his wife live in a spacious, two-bedroom apartment with a solarium and two terraces. The apartment in an elegant building on the prestigious avenue is worth at least $5,000 a month, real-estate professionals say. The couple pay around $350, according to rent records.{58}\nThis example of cheap rent for the a\ufb04uent or the wealthy under rent control was by no means unique. Ironically, a statistical study indicated that the biggest di\ufb00erence between prices under New York\u2019s rent control law and free-market prices is in luxury apartments.{59} In other words, the a\ufb04uent and the wealthy get more economic bene\ufb01t from rent control than do the poor who are invoked to justify such laws.  Meanwhile, city welfare agencies have paid much higher rents than those just mentioned when they housed poverty-stricken families in cramped and roach-infested apartments in run-down hotels.  In 2013, the New York Times reported that the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services was \u201cspending over $3,000 a month for each threadb are room without a bathroom or kitchen\u201d in a single room occupancy hotel\u2014half of that money going to the landlord for rent and the other half for \u201csecurity and social services for homeless tenants.\u201d{60} The image that rent control protects poor tenants from rich landlords may be politically e\ufb00ective, but often it bears little resemblance to the reality.  The people who actually bene\ufb01t from rent control can be at any income level and so can those who lose out.  It depends on who happens to be on the inside looking out, and who happens to be on the outside looking in, when such laws are passed.  San Francisco\u2019s rent control laws are not as old as those in New York City but they are similarly severe\u2014and have produced very similar results.  A study published in 2001 showed that more than one-fourth of the occupants of rent-controlled apartments in San Francisco had household incomes of more than $100,000 a year.{61} It should also be noted that this was the \ufb01rst empirical study of rent control commissioned by the city of San Francisco.  Since rent control began\nthere in 1979, this means that for more than two decades these laws were enforced and extended, with no serious attempt being made to measure their actual economic and social consequences, as distinguished from their political popularity.  Ironically, cities with strong rent control laws, such as New York and San Francisco, tend to end up with higher average rents than cities without rent control.{62} Where such laws apply only to rents below some speci\ufb01ed level, presumably to protect the poor, builders then have incentives to build only apartments luxurious enough to be priced above the rent-control level.

Thus a relatively small shortage of gasoline nationally could turn into a very serious problem for those motorists who happened to run out of gas and had to look for a \ufb01lling station that was open and had gas to sell. The sudden severity of the gasoline shortage\u2014given how little di\ufb00erence there was in the total amount of gasoline produced\u2014ba\ufb04ed many people and produced various conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracy theories was that oil companies had their tankers from the Middle East circling around in the ocean, waiting for a price increase before coming ashore with their cargoes. Although none of these conspiracy theories stood up under scrutiny, there was a kernel of sense behind them, as there usually is behind most fallacies. A severe shortage of gasoline with very little di\ufb00erence in the total amount of gasoline produced meant that there had to be a large amount of gasoline being diverted somewhere. Few of those who created or believed conspiracy theories suspected that the excess was being stored in their own gas tanks, rather than in oil tankers circling in\nthe ocean.

The feasibility of hoarding varies with di\ufb00erent goods, so the e\ufb00ect of price controls also varies. For example, price controls on strawberries might lead to less of a shortage than price controls on gasoline, since strawberries are too perishable to be hoarded for long. Price controls on haircuts or other services may also create less of a shortage because services cannot be hoarded. That is, you would not get two haircuts on the same day if you found a barber with time available, in order to go twice as long before the next haircut, even though barbers might be less available when the price of haircuts was kept down by price controls. Nevertheless, some unlikely things do get hoarded under price controls. For example, under rent control, people may keep an apartment that they seldom use, as some Hollywood stars have kept rent-controlled apartments in Manhattan where they would stay when visiting New York.{64} Mayor Ed Koch kept his rent-controlled apartment during the entire 12 years when he lived in Gracie Mansion, the o\ufb03cial residence of New York\u2019s mayor.{65} In 2008, it was revealed that New York Congressman Charles Rangel had four rent-controlled apartments, one of which he used as an o\ufb03ce.{66} Hoarding is a special case of the more general economic principle that more is demanded at a lower price and of the corollary that price controls allow lower priority uses to preempt higher priority uses, increasing the severity of the shortages, whether of apartments or of gasoline.\nSometimes the reduction in supply under price controls takes forms that are less obvious.

Scarcity versus Shortage One of the crucial distinctions to keep in mind is the distinction between an increased scarcity\u2014where fewer goods are available relative to the population\u2014an d a \u201cshortage\u201d as a price phenomenon. Just as there can be a growing shortage without an increased scarcity, so there can be a growing scarcity without a shortage. As already noted, there was a severe housing shortage in the United States during and immediately after the Second World War,\neven though the ratio of housing to people was the same as it had been before the war, when there was no housing shortage. It is also possible to have the opposite situation, where the actual amount of housing suddenly declines in a given area without any price control\u2014 and without any shortage. This happened in the wake of the great San Francisco earthquake and \ufb01re of 1906. More than half the city\u2019s housing supply was destroyed in just three days during that catastrophe. Yet there was no housing shortage. When the San Francisco Chronicle resumed publication a month after the earthquake, its \ufb01rst issue contained 64 advertisements of apartments or homes for rent, compared to only 5 ads from people seeking apartments to live in. Of the 200,000 people suddenly made homeless by the earthquake and \ufb01re, temporary shelters housed 30,000 and an estimated 75,000 left the city.{63} Still, that left nearly 100,000 people to be absorbed into the local housing market. Yet the newspapers of that time mention no housing shortage. Rising prices not only allocate existing housing, they provide incentives for rebuilding and for renters to use less space in the meantime, as well as incentives for those with space in their homes to take in roomers while rents are high. In short, just as there can be a shortage without any greater physical scarcity, so there can be a greater physical scarcity without any shortage. People made homeless by the huge 1906 San Francisco earthquake found housing more readily than people made homeless by New York\u2019s rent control laws that took thousands of buildings o\ufb00 the market. Hoarding In addi tion to shortages and quality deterioration under price\ncontrols, there is often hoarding\u2014that is, individuals keeping a larger inventory of the price-controlled goods than they would ordinarily under free market conditions, because of the uncertainty of being able to \ufb01nd it in the future. Thus, during the gasoline shortages of the 1970s, motorists were less likely to let their gas tanks get down as low as usual before going to a \ufb01lling station to buy more gas.  Some motorists with their tanks half full would drive into any \ufb01lling station that happened to have gas, and \ufb01ll up the other half, as a precaution.  With millions of motorists driving around with their gas tanks more full than usual, vast amounts of gasoline disappeared into individual inventories, leaving less available for sale from the general inventory at \ufb01lling stations.  Thus a relatively small shortage of gasoline nationally could turn into a very serious problem for those motorists who happened to run out of gas and had to look for a \ufb01lling station that was open and had gas to sell.  The sudden severity of the gasoline shortage\u2014given how little di\ufb00erence there was in the total amount of gasoline produced\u2014ba\ufb04ed many people and produced various conspiracy theories.  One of these conspiracy theories was that oil companies had their tankers from the Middle East circling around in the ocean, waiting for a price increase before coming ashore with their cargoes.  Although none of these conspiracy theories stood up under scrutiny, there was a kernel of sense behind them, as there usually is behind most fallacies.  A severe shortage of gasoline with very little di\ufb00erence in the total amount of gasoline produced meant that there had to be a large amount of gasoline being diverted somewhere.  Few of those who created or believed conspiracy theories suspected that the excess was being stored in their own gas tanks, rather than in oil tankers circling in\nthe ocean.  This increased the severity of the gasoline shortage because maintaining millions of larger individual inventories of gasoline in cars and trucks was less e\ufb03cient than maintaining general inventories in \ufb01lling stations\u2019 storage tanks.  The feasibility of hoarding varies with di\ufb00erent goods, so the e\ufb00ect of price controls also varies.  For example, price controls on strawberries might lead to less of a shortage than price controls on gasoline, since strawberries are too perishable to be hoarded for long.  Price controls on haircuts or other services may also create less of a shortage because services cannot be hoarded.  That is, you would not get two haircuts on the same day if you found a barber with time available, in order to go twice as long before the next haircut, even though barbers might be less available when the price of haircuts was kept down by price controls.

In short, more people make more claims on doctors\u2019 time under price control, leaving less time for other people with more serious, or even urgent, medical problems.  Thus, under Britain\u2019s government- controlled medical system, a twelve-year-old girl was given a breast implant while 10,000 people waited 15 months or more for surgery.{73} A woman with cancer had her operation postponed so many times that the malignancy eventually became inoperable.{74} The priorities which prices automatically cause individuals to consider are among the \ufb01rst casualties of price controls.  A study conducted by the international agency Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that, among \ufb01ve English-speaking countries surveyed, only in the United States was the percentage of patients waiting for elective surgery for more than four months in single digits.  All the other English-speaking countries\u2014 Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom\u2014had more than 20 percent of their patients waiting more than four months, with 38 percent of those in the United Kingdom waiting at least that long.  In this group, the United States was the only country without government-set prices for medical treatment.  Incidentally, the term \u201celective surgery\u201d was not con\ufb01ned to cosmetic surgery or other medically unnecessary procedures, but in this study included cataract surgery, hip replacement and coronary bypass surgery.{75} Delayed medical treatment is one aspect of quality deterioration when prices are set below the levels that would prevail under supply and demand.  The quality of the treatment received is also a\ufb00ected\nwhen doctors spend less time per patient.  In countries around the world, the amount of time that physicians spend per patient visit has been shorter under government-controlled medical care prices, compared to the time spent by physicians where prices are not controlled.  Black markets are another common feature of price controls that apply to medical care as to other things.  In China and Japan, black markets have taken the form of bribes to doctors to get expedited treatment.  In short, whether the product or service has been housing, apples, or medical care, quality deterioration under price control has been common in the most disparate settings.  PRICE \u201cFLOORS\u201d AND SURPLUSES Just as a price set below the level that would prevail by supply and demand in a free market tends to cause more to be demanded and less to be supplied, creating a shortage at the imposed price, so a price set above the free market level tends to cause more to be supplied than demanded, creating a surplus.

        "mixed_chunk": "In short, more people make more claims on doctors\u2019 time under price control, leaving less time for other people with more serious, or even urgent, medical problems.  Thus, under Britain\u2019s government- controlled medical system, a twelve-year-old girl was given a breast implant while 10,000 people waited 15 months or more for surgery.{73} A woman with cancer had her operation postponed so many times that the malignancy eventually became inoperable.{74} The priorities which prices automatically cause individuals to consider are among the \ufb01rst casualties of price controls.  A study conducted by the international agency Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that, among \ufb01ve English-speaking countries surveyed, only in the United States was the percentage of patients waiting for elective surgery for more than four months in single digits.  All the other English-speaking countries\u2014 Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom\u2014had more than 20 percent of their patients waiting more than four months, with 38 percent of those in the United Kingdom waiting at least that long.  In this group, the United States was the only country without government-set prices for medical treatment.  Incidentally, the term \u201celective surgery\u201d was not con\ufb01ned to cosmetic surgery or other medically unnecessary procedures, but in this study included cataract surgery, hip replacement and coronary bypass surgery.{75} Delayed medical treatment is one aspect of quality deterioration when prices are set below the levels that would prevail under supply and demand.  The quality of the treatment received is also a\ufb00ected\nwhen doctors spend less time per patient.  In countries around the world, the amount of time that physicians spend per patient visit has been shorter under government-controlled medical care prices, compared to the time spent by physicians where prices are not controlled.  Black markets are another common feature of price controls that apply to medical care as to other things.  In China and Japan, black markets have taken the form of bribes to doctors to get expedited treatment.  In short, whether the product or service has been housing, apples, or medical care, quality deterioration under price control has been common in the most disparate settings.  PRICE \u201cFLOORS\u201d AND SURPLUSES Just as a price set below the level that would prevail by supply and demand in a free market tends to cause more to be demanded and less to be supplied, creating a shortage at the imposed price, so a price set above the free market level tends to cause more to be supplied than demanded, creating a surplus.  Among the tragedies of the Great Depression of the 1930s was the fact that man y American farmers simply could not make enough money from the sale of their crops to pay their bills. The prices of farm products fell much more drastically than the prices of the things that farmers bought. Farm income fell from just over $6 billion in 1929 to $2 billion in 1932.{76} As many farmers lost their farms because they could no longer\npay the mortgages, and as other farm families su\ufb00ered privations as they struggled to hang on to their farms and their traditional way of life, the federal government sought to restore what was called \u201cparity\u201d between agriculture and other sectors of the economy by intervening to keep farm prices from falling so sharply. This intervention took various forms. One approach was to reduce by law the amount of various crops that could be grown and sold, so as to prevent the supply from driving the price below the level that government o\ufb03cials had decided upon. Thus, supplies of peanuts and cotton were restricted by law. Supplies of citrus fruit, nuts and various other farm products were regulated by local cartels of farmers, backed up by the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to issue \u201cmarketing orders\u201d and prosecute those who violated these orders by producing and selling more than they were authorized to produce and sell. Such arrangements continued for decades after the poverty of the Great Depression was replaced by the prosperity of the economic boom following World War II, and many of these restrictions continue to this day. These indirect methods of keeping prices arti\ufb01cially high were only part of the story. The key factor in keeping farm prices arti\ufb01cially higher than they would have been under free market supply and demand was the government\u2019s willingness to buy up the surpluses created by its control of prices. This they did for such farm products as corn, rice, tobacco, and wheat, among others\u2014and many of these programs continue on to the present as well. Regardless of what group was initially supposed to be helped by these programs, the very existence of such programs bene\ufb01tted others as well, and these new bene\ufb01ciaries made it politically di\ufb03cult to end such programs, even\nlong after the initial conditions had changed and the initial bene\ufb01ciaries were now a small part of the constituency politically organized and determined to keep these programs going.{vii} Price control in the form of a \u201c\ufb02oor\u201d under prices, preventing these prices from falling further, produced surpluses as dramatic as the shortages produced by price control in the form of a \u201cceiling\u201d preventing prices from rising higher.  In some years, the federal government bought more than one-fourth of all the wheat grown in the United States and took it o\ufb00 the market, in order to maintain prices at a pre-determined level.  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, agricultural price support programs led to vast amounts of food being deliberately destroyed, at a time when malnutrition was a serious problem in the United States and hunger marches were taking place in cities across the country.  For example, the federal government bought 6 million hogs in 1933 alone and destroyed them.{77} Huge amounts of farm produce were plowed under, in order to keep it o\ufb00 the market and maintain prices at the o\ufb03cially \ufb01xed level, while vast amounts of milk were poured down the sewers for the same reason.  Meanwhile, many American children were su\ufb00ering from diseases caused by malnutrition.  Still, there was a food surplus.  A surplus, like a shortage, is a price phenomenon.  A surplus does not mean that there is some excess relative to the people.  There was not \u201ctoo much\u201d food relative to the population during the Great Depression.  The people simply did not have enough money to buy everything that was produced at the arti\ufb01cially high prices set by the government.  A very similar situation existed in poverty-stricken India at the beginning of the twenty-\ufb01rst\ncentury, where there was a surplus of wheat and rice under government price supports.  The Far Eastern Economic Review reported: India\u2019s public stock of food grains is at an all-time high, and next spring, it will grow still further to a whopping 80 million tonnes, or four times the amount necessary in case of a national emergency.  Yet while that wheat and rice sits idle\u2014in some cases for years, to the point of rotting\u2014 millions of Indians don\u2019t have enough to eat.{78} A report from India in the New York Times told a very similar story under the headline, \u201cPoor in India Starve as Surplus Wheat Rots\u201d: Surplus from this year\u2019s wheat harvest, bought by the government from farmers, sits moldering in muddy \ufb01elds here in Punjab State.  Some of the previous year\u2019s wheat surplus sits untouched, too, and the year\u2019s before that, and the year\u2019s before that.  To the south, in the neighboring state of Rajasthan, villagers ate boiled leaves or discs of bread made from grass seeds in late summer and autumn because they could not a\ufb00ord to buy wheat.  One by one, children and adults\u2014as many as 47 in all\u2014wilted away from hunger-related causes, often clutching pained stomachs.{79} A surplus or \u201cglut\u201d of food in India, where malnutrition is still a serious problem, might seem like a contradiction in terms.

In 2002, the U.S. Congress passed a farm subsidy bill that was estimated to cost the average American family more than $4,000 over the following decade in taxes and in\ufb02ated food prices.{85} Nor was this a new development. During the mid-1980s, when the price of sugar on the world market was four cents a pound, the wholesale price within the United States was 20 cents a pound.{86} The government was subsidizing the production of something that Americans could have gotten cheaper by not producing it at all, and buying it from countries in the tropics. This has been true of sugar for decades. Moreover, sugar is not unique in this respect, nor is the United States. In the nations of the European Union, the prices of lamb, butter, and sugar are all more than twice as high as their world market prices.{87} As a writer for the Wall Street Journal put it, every cow in the European Union gets more subsidies per day than most sub-Saharan Africans have to live on.{88}\nAlthough the original rationale for the American price-support programs was to save family farms, in practice more of the money went to big agricultural corporations, some of which received millions of dollars each, while the average farm received only a few hundred dollars.

In the United States, the vast amount of storage space required to keep surplus crops o\ufb00 the market once led to such desperate expedients as storing these farm products in unused warships, when all the storage facilities on land had been \ufb01lled to capacity. Otherwise, American wheat would have had to be left outside to rot, as in India. A series of bumper crops in the United States could lead to the\nfederal government\u2019s having more wheat in storage than was grown by American farmers all year. In India, it was reported in 2002 that the Indian government was spending more on storage of its surplus produce than on rural development, irrigation and \ufb02ood control combined.{80} It was a classic example of a misallocation of scare resources which have alternative uses, especially in a poor country. So long as the market price of the agricultural product covered by price controls stays above the level at which the government is legally obligated to buy it, the product is sold in the market at a price determined by supply and demand. But, when there is either a su\ufb03cient increase in the amount supplied or a su\ufb03cient reduction in the amount demanded, the resulting lower price can fall to a level at which the government buys what the market is unwilling to buy. For example, when powdered milk was selling in the United States for about $2.20 a pound in 2007, it was sold in the market but, when the price fell to 80 cents a pound in 2008, the U.S. Department of Agriculture found itself legally obligated to buy about 112 million pounds of powdered milk at a total cost exceeding $90 million.{81} None of this is peculiar to the United States or to India. The countries of the European Union spent $39 billion in direct subsidies in 2002 and their consumers spent twice as much as that in the in\ufb02ated food prices created by these agricultural programs.{82} Meanwhile, the surplus food has been sold below cost on the world market, driving down the prices that Third World farmers could get for their produce. In all these countries, not only the government but also the consumers are paying for agricultural price-support programs\u2014the government directly in payments to farmers and storage companies, and the consumers in in\ufb02ated food prices. As of 2001, American consumers\nwere paying $1.9 billion a year in arti\ufb01cially higher prices, just for products containing sugar, while the government was paying $1.4 million per month just to store the surplus sugar.

Those on food stamps are able to buy\nless food with those stamps when food prices are arti\ufb01cially in\ufb02ated. From a purely economic standpoint, it is working at cross purposes to subsidize farmers by forcing food prices up and then subsidize some consumers by bringing down their particular costs of food with subsidies\u2014as is done in both India and the United States. However, from a political standpoint, it makes perfect sense to gain the support of two di\ufb00erent sets of voters, especially since most of them do not understand the full economic implications of the policies. Even when agricultural subsidies and price controls originated during hard times as a humanitarian measure, they have persisted long past those times because they developed an organized constituency which threatened to create political trouble if these subsidies and controls were removed or even reduced. Farmers have blocked the streets of Paris with their farm machinery when the French government showed signs of scaling back its agricultural programs or allowing more foreign farm produce to be imported. In Canada, farmers protesting low wheat prices blocked highways and formed a motorcade of tractors to the capital city of Ottawa. While only about one-tenth of farm income in the United States comes from government subsidies, about half of farm income in South Korea comes from such subsidies, as does 60 percent in Norway.{91} THE POLITICS OF PRICE CONTROLS Simple as basic economic principles may be, their rami\ufb01cations can be quite complex, as we have seen with the various e\ufb00ects of rent\ncontrol laws and agricultural price support laws.

In 2007, Zimbabwe\u2019s government\nresponded to runaway in\ufb02ation by ordering sellers to cut prices in half or more.  Just a month later, the New York Times reported, \u201cZimbabwe\u2019s economy is at a halt.\u201d It detailed some speci\ufb01cs: Bread, sugar and cornmeal, staples of every Zimbabwean\u2019s diet, have vanished, seized by mobs who denuded stores like locusts in wheat \ufb01elds.  Meat is virtually nonexistent, even for members of the middle class who have money to buy it on the black market.  Gasoline is nearly unobtainable.  Hospital patients are dying for lack of basic medical supplies.  Power blackouts and water cuto\ufb00s are endemic.{95} As with price controls in other times and places, price controls were viewed favorably by the public when they were \ufb01rst imposed in Zimbabwe.  \u201cOrdinary citizens initially greeted the price cuts with a euphoric\u2014an d short-lived\u2014shopping spree,\u201d according to the New York Times.{96} Both the initial reactions and the later consequences were much as they had been in Antwerp, centuries earlier.  When a local area is devastated by a hurricane or some other natural disaster, many people consider it unconscionable if businesses in that area suddenly raise the prices of such things as bottled water, \ufb02ashlights or gasoline\u2014or if local hotels double or triple the prices of their rooms when there are many local people suddenly made homeless who are seeking temporary shelter.  Often price controls are regarded as a necessary quick \ufb01x in this situation.  The political response has often been to pass laws against \u201cprice gouging\u201d to stop such unpopular practices.  Yet the role of prices in allocating scarce resources is even more urgently needed when local resources have suddenly become more scarce than usual, relative to the increased demand from people suddenly deprived of the resources normally available to them, as a result of the destruction created by\nstorms or wild\ufb01res or some other natural disaster.  Where homes have been destroyed, for example, the demand for local hotel rooms may rise suddenly, while the supply of hotel rooms at best remains the same, assuming that none of these hotels has been damaged or destroyed. When the local population wants more hotel rooms than there are available locally, these rooms will have to be rationed, one way or another, whether by prices or in some other way. If the prices of hotel rooms remain what they have been in normal times, those who happen to arrive at the hotels \ufb01rst will take all the rooms, and those who arrive later will either have to sleep outdoors, or in damaged homes that may o\ufb00er little protection from the weather, or else leave the local area and thus leave their homes vulnerable to looters. But, if hotel prices rise sharply, people will have incentives to ration themselves. A couple with children, who might rent one hotel room for themselves and another for their children, when the prices are kept down to their normal level, will have incentives to rent just one room for the whole family when the rents are abnormally high\u2014 that is, when there is \u201cprice gouging.\u201d Similar principles apply when there are local shortages of other things suddenly in higher demand in the local area. If electric power has been knocked out locally, the demand for \ufb02ashlights may greatly exceed the supply. If the prices of \ufb02ashlights remain the same as before, those who arrive \ufb01rst at stores selling \ufb02ashlights may quickly exhaust the local supply, so that those who arrive later are unable to \ufb01nd any more \ufb02ashlights available. However, if the prices of \ufb02ashlights skyrocket, a family that might otherwise buy multiple \ufb02ashlights for its members is more likely to make do with just one of the unusually expensive \ufb02ashlights\u2014which means that there will be more \ufb02ashlights\nleft for others. If there is an increased demand for gasoline, whether for electric generators or to drive automobiles to other areas to shop for things in short supply locally, or to move out of the stricken local area entirely, this can create a shortage of gasoline until new supplies can arrive at \ufb01lling stations or until electric power is fully restored, so that the pumps at more \ufb01lling stations can operate. If the price of gasoline remains what it has been in normal times, those who get to the \ufb01lling stations \ufb01rst may \ufb01ll up their gas tanks and exhaust the local supply, leaving those who arrive later with no gasoline to buy. But, if the price of gasoline skyrockets, motorists who arrive earlier may buy just enough of the unusually expensive gasoline to get them out of the area of local destruction, so that they can then \ufb01ll up their gas tanks much less expensively in places less a\ufb00ected by the natural disaster.  That leaves more gasoline available locally for others.  When local prices spike, that a\ufb00ects supply as well, both before and after the natural disaster.  The arrival of a hurricane is usually foreseen by meteorologists, and their predictions of approaching hurricanes are usually widely reported.  Supplies of all sorts of things that are usually needed after a hurricane strikes\u2014\ufb02ashlights, bottled water, gasoline and lumber, for example\u2014are more likely to be rushed to the area where the hurricane is likely to strike, before the hurricane actually gets there, if suppliers anticipate higher prices.  This means that shortages can be mitigated in advance.  But if only the usual prices in normal times can be expected, there is less incentive to incur the extra costs of rushing things to an area where disaster is expected to strike.  Similar incentives exist after a hurricane or other disaster has\nstruck.  To replenish supplies in a devastated area can cost more, due to damaged roads and highways, debris and congested tra\ufb03c from people \ufb02eeing the area.  Skyrocketing local prices can overcome the reluctance to take on these local obstacles that entail additional costs.  Moreover, each supplier has incentives to try to be the \ufb01rst to arrive on the scene, since that is when prices will be highest, before additional suppliers arrive and their competition drives prices back down.  Time is also of great importance to people in a disaster area, who need a continuous supply of food and other necessities.  Prices are not the only way to ration scarce resources, either in normal times or in times of sudden increases in scarcity.  But the question is whether alternative systems of rationing are usually better or worse.  History shows repeatedly the e\ufb00ect of price controls on food in creating hunger or even starvation.  It might be possible for sellers to ration how much they will sell to one buyer.  But this puts the seller in the unenviable role of o\ufb00ending some of his customers by refusing to let them buy as much as they want\u2014and he may lose some of those customers after things return to normal.  Few sellers may be willing to risk that.  The net result of having neither price rationing nor non-price rationing may well be the situation described in the wake of the super storm \u201cSandy\u201d in 2012, as reported in the Wall Street Journal: At one New Jersey supermarket, shoppers barely paused for a public loudspeaker announcement urging them to buy only the provisions needed for a couple of days of suburban paralysis.
