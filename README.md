this repo has some quick projects that i made in my free time 
1. master-oto-wykres
    go to oto-wykres.azurewebssites.net ( first time load takes some time because Azure shuts down sites if they are  not visited)
    This site lets you take a look at the otomoto data if you are looking for a car. 

2. master-podcastize 
    I made podcasts from pdfs.
